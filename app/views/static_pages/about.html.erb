<h1>About</h1>
<p>After graduating college in 2011 with a degree in film, I found myself unable to secure a job in the field I thought I wanted to enter. In addition, I gradually realized that despite my love for storytelling and film, I did not want a career in the entertainment industry. To make matters worse, I had no clue what I wanted to do. Cue the two-year quarter-life crisis. Although this period was not without it’s despondency, it did give me the time to read some of the best books I’ve ever read, which drastically improved my outlook on many things (I’ve included some in my recommended reading section). But more most importantly, it was during this time that I was introduced to what I have now decided to make my career: Programming.

During this time, my good friend Matt,  a programmer, had suggested I learn coding in my spare time, with the goal of making it my future career. Knowing absolutely nothing about it and assuming you had to be a genius to work with computers, I brushed his suggestions off, despite being informed that not only was a degree not required to enter the field, but that many people from completely unrelated fields were transitioning to programming. I don’t know what prompted me to do so, but one day I finally caved in to his prodding. I agreed I would dedicate at least thirty minutes a day. I started on Zed Shaw’s “Learn Python the Hard Way”. After some initial frustrations, something clicked, and about halfway through the course, my thirty-minute pledge quickly escalated to coding in all my free time. Not only was I enjoying it, but I found it fascinating, and it synchronized with the logical and creative aspects of my personality. I then delved into “Head First Java”, which introduced me to the concepts of OOP.  It was around this time I discovered the existence of coding bootcamps, and my enthusiasm shot through the roof. When I learned about App Academy’s payment plan and track record, I became even more determined.

I’m going to cap this essay right now, otherwise this will stay on this text document and never feel the warm embrace of a paragraph tag.
